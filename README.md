<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Using ssr \ ssg on next.js you get an html but with react and react-dom packages. This is reasonable but js cause render blocking and reduce performance</p> 
<p>In <a href='www.nathankrasney.com'>www.nathankrasney.com</a> i have posts which are static but i have top and header component. How to create an html from componet ? doing this i can use next.js like in <a href='https://github.com/NathanKr/next.js-serve-static-html-page-playground'>next.js-serve-static-html-page-playground</a> and serve html that i create my self without react and react-dom</p>
